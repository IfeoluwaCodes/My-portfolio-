  <h3>HTML</h3>
  <ul>

  <h4>Text</h4>
  <p>
    i understand most of the text stuff.
    p is for paragraph. 
    body is as the name implies.
    title is the same.
    head is also the same.
    The h is also like normal.
    ul is to list bullets.
    li is the lists.
    All of them have closing tags that is(/ thier name)
  </p>
  
  <h4>Imaging</h4>
  <p>This is a basic image use in html.
  img does not have closing tag</p>
  <img src="IMG-20260103-WA0009.jpg"alt="Profile Image">

  <h4>Link</h4>
  <p>The target=blank is to open in a new page
    and its better to put the link in a paragraph 
  <p>
  <a href="https://github.com/ifeoluwacodes"target=_blank>
    Visit my github profile</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    My goal is to build real websites and earn from my skills.

  <h4>Text</h4>
  <p>
    (i) understand most of the text stuff.
    (p) is for paragraph. 
    (body) is as the name implies.
    (title) is the same.
    (head) is also the same.
    The (h) is also like normal.
    (ul) is to list bullets.
    (li) is the lists.
    All of them have closing tags that is(/ thier name)
  </p>
  
  <h4>Imaging</h4>
  <p>This is a basic image use in html.
  (img) does not have closing tag</p>
  <img src="IMG-20260103-WA0009.jpg"alt="Profile Image">

  <h4>Link</h4>
  <p>The (target=blank) is to open in a new page
    and its better to put the link in a paragraph.After the target blank,write what you want to be written as the link before closing the link.

  </p>

  <h4>Containing</h4>
  <p>Its tag is (div) and it's starts from the beginning of the body and ends just before the body's closing tag.
  </p>
    
    <p>The CSS sytax for it should have a dot at the front 
    </p>

  <p>
    My goal is to build real websites and earn from my skills.
